        <h1>About us</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Anime Gallery</strong> — a fun and creative space built by fans, for fans.</p>

  <p>This site was created just for fun, to celebrate the wide world of anime character tropes — from the sweet and shy to the wild and obsessive. We’ve gathered some of the most iconic types like <strong>Yandere</strong>, <strong>Tsundere</strong>, <strong>Yuri</strong>, and more, so you can explore and learn what makes each one unique.</p>

  <p>Our personal favorite? Definitely the <strong>Yandere</strong>. There’s just something unforgettable about a character who’ll do *anything* for love (even if it’s a little terrifying 🩸).</p>

  <p>We hope this gallery helps you discover (or obsess over) the anime personalities you love most. And who knows — maybe you’ll find a new favorite along the way.</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting, and enjoy the chaos, the cuteness, and the characters!</p>
